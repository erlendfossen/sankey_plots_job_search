Scripts to make sankey plots from two separate job search periods: 2020-2021 (applying widely to different jobs in Norway and Sweden, around half permanent) & 2022-2024 (applying narrowly to only permanent jobs in Oslo). Note that some of the ghosting in 2024 may be due to job search ending recently (i.e. they may send a rejection in 1-2 months).

**Results from 2020-2021 job search:**
